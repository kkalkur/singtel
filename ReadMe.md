﻿﻿﻿﻿# Git Repo General Instruction### Pre requisite- Java 8 needs to present in the system---### How to Clone the repo and Build the Project-  How to clone the repo -  Run the following command`git clone https://github.com/kkalkur/singtel.git`- To build the project use the following command`gradlew clean build`- To import the Project in eclipse first run the following command `gradlew eclispe`-  Import the project in eclipse as gradle project----### Run the Test cases I have written a test cases for all the 4 Assignment To test each of the assignment Problem runt the following test cases 1. **BirdTest** for Assignment A 1st Problem1. **DuckTest** and Chicken Test for Assignment A 2 nd Problem1. **RoosterTest** for Assignment A 3 rd Problem1. **ParrotTest** for Assignment A 4 th Problem1. **FishTest** for Assignment B 1st th Problem1. **SharkTest** for Assignment B 2 nd Problem1. **DolohinTest** for Assignment B 3 nd Problem1. **ButterflyTest** for  Assignment D 1 st Problem1. **Animal CountTest** for Assignment E Oroblem## The design principle's used to solve these problems1. Program for Interface1. Favor composition over inheritance 1. Strategy design Pattern is used extensively  ---The following class diagram explains the over all design ![alt text](https://github.com/kkalkur/singtel/blob/master/AnimalClassDiagram1.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")All the behaviors of animals such as FlyBehaviour, SingBehaviour  are separated and **capsulated** into a separate interface . There will be concrete implementation of each Behaviors such as FlyingBird or FlyNoWay for each of the FlyBehaviour. Each Animal will have composed of many of the behaviors . We have encapsulated behavior which varies per Animal into a separate class and each Animal is composing the various behavior .During the creation of the Objects each behavior can be injected into the Animal .  For example``` public Bird() {		singBehaviour =new SingingBird();		walkBehaviour =   new WalkingAnimal();		flybehaviour = new FlyingBird();	}```This can be done by a Dependency Injection framework as well .   Here we are Favoring **composition**  over inheritance . This gives us lots of flexibility at runtime . We can change the behavior of the Animal by injecting a new behavior .### How did I implement various Parrots In case of Parrot we do not need to create new **Specialize Parrots Class**  for various singing behavior we can simply **create a new singing behavior** and inject into existing Parrot class ---The following class Diagram shows the Behavior Hierarchy ![alt text](https://github.com/kkalkur/singtel/blob/master/Behaviour.jpg "Logo Title Text 1")
